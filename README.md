<br>

I wanted to make this app with flutter because I was interested in flutter developer roles.  I figured out this payment interface is a fundamental and common fragment of almost every app, since almost every app requires some sort of payment/transaction interface to be present, be it a video streaming service like Netflix or Disney+ during signing up for subscription or  a social networking platform like facebook or Instagram where an user needs to add their card details for promoting their content to reach more users. I wanted to build something that would cover demonstration of a wide range of skills required for an app developer, like - knowledge of architectural components & design patterns, state management/nested state management with provider, fetching data from servers to demonstrate proficiency with restful API to connect applications to back-end services, building a real time interface, using the Camera API, writing data to local files, custom navigation stack, complex animations, seamlessly incorporating third party packages, pixel-perfect implementation of UI designs (differs only because some improvisations I made), debugging, analysis skills & performance tuning. 

<br>

### FEATURES

  1. Fund Transfer - mock simulation only, a transaction request is made to the server, the server is programmed to respond with 66.666% probability of successfully executing the transaction so as to simulate real world experirence (in the future this probability can increased to 75% or more).
  
  <!-- 2. Scan to Pay - mock simulation only, QR Code Scanner is programmed to only recognize QR Codes of HADWIN accounts. -->

  2. Credit Card Validator and Storage - credit card details will be stored locally and not shared with the server, the validator is programmed to recognize cards belonging to American Express, VISA, MasterCard, Discover.
  3. Real-Time username availability checker - part of sign up process.

NOTE: Since this is a prototype users cannot send or receive real money, or create real accounts, users need to login/register with test data provided here ‚û°Ô∏è [https://github.com/brownboycodes/HADWIN/blob/master/docs/HADWIN_WIKI.md](https://github.com/brownboycodes/HADWIN/blob/master/docs/HADWIN_WIKI.md).
Transaction and credit card data will be saved on the users device itself and not shared with the server.

<br>

Some custom system utilities built by me :-

1. custom tab navigation stack
2. custom keypad and input field for fund transfer screen
3. custom card flow widget
4. custom transaction receipt generator
5. error alerts
6. search and sort systems for filtering past transactions, contacts and business organiztions
7. local client-side databases

### WORKFLOW

The flowchart below provides a brief overview of the activities that take place when the app is launched

<br>

<p align="center"><img src="./media/flowcharts/app-launch-process-flowchart.png" alt="FruitCastle banner" width="80%"></p>

<br>
Post successful user authentication an authorized session would last upto 2 hours.
The login process is quite sophisticated on its own and it might get too overwhelming trying to understand it from reading the code, the flowchart below provides an overview of activities that take place during the login process, perhaps it will clear up the doubts behind the logic

<!-- If users want to test the QR code scanning feature of HADWIN, they are requested to go to [https://fruitcastle.onrender.com/hadwin/v2/qr-code-interpretter/random](https://fruitcastle.onrender.com/hadwin/v2/qr-code-interpretter/random) to obtain a random QR code image. -->

Users are requested to rest assured as no personal data is being saved on the server and if they are still concerned about their privacy users are allowed to test the app with the [mock data](./docs/HADWIN_WIKI.md) only.

### TASKS TO DO üìÉ

<br>

The tasks have been laid out in the format `task_type (SCOPE): the_task` and these tasks have been sorted in terms of their difficulty. Some tasks may accompany some conditions which have to be met before attempting, read and understand them carefully since a small unrectified mistake can wreck this project completely. Check the [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) first.

<br>

#### Tasks ‚§µ

1. feature (UIUX): in the Login process, an alert box with an error message received from the server pops up every time a user enters the wrong credentials, create a counter that would track the number of times the user enters an username or email ID that does not belong to any account on the server, if the counter hits 3 times in a row then show an [option to take the user to the sign up screen](./media/ui_designs/alert-box-to-navigate-to-sign-up-screen-design.png) in the alert box that would appear. Maintain the existing UI and experience while doing so. üö∏‚ú®
2. fix (UIUX): debug the Sign Up process, hopefully it can contain some flaws or maybe it can be simplified further while maintaining the existing UI and experience (hint: check the UI/UX of the sign up screen and its components for errors if any). üö∏üêõü©π
3. refactor : use [StreamBuilder](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StreamBuilder-class.html) in ChooseUsernameScreen
4. build (DEPENDENCIES): upgrade to the latest version of the flutter SDK without failing the build and crashing the app üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüèó‚¨Üüí•
5. build (DEPENDENCIES): if the flutter SDK version of the project is the latest available upgrade the dependencies of the project to the latest available version without failing the build and crashing the app üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚¨Üüí•
6. build (DEPENDENCIES): if the flutter SDK version of the project is the latest available and the package [qr_code_scanner](https://pub.dev/packages/qr_code_scanner) has been discontinued, replace [qr_code_scanner](https://pub.dev/packages/qr_code_scanner) with [mobile_scanner](https://pub.dev/packages/mobile_scanner) and implement it without crashing the app. ‚ûñüì¶‚ûï
7. feature (LOCALIZATION): make HADWIN available in other languages (japanese, hindi, bengali, mandarin, spanish, french, german etc.) üåê
8. test : write some meaningful tests maybe? üß™ü§î

### ‚ö† IMPORTANT ‚ö†



**HADWIN** has been created purely out of my own interest in building a sophisticated fund transfer platform for adding value to my portfolio. Again it is being reminded that users cannot transfer/receive real money through this app (as of now), users are warned and forbidden from using real credit/debit card numbers or bank account numbers. Users may and if possible should only test this application with [mock data](./docs/HADWIN_WIKI.md) provided from my personal API hosting server (**FruitCastle** ([source code üí°]((https://github.com/brownboycodes/FruitCastle))). Account numbers and User details are fictitious, they have been generated randomly out of imagination, any resemblance of mock data with real people or account numbers is matter of sheer coincidence. The creator of this project not be/ cannot be held responsible for loss of any kind.
